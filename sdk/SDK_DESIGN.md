# SDK Design Notes

## Architecture: Plumbing vs Porcelain

The SDK has two layers, inspired by Git's architecture:

### Plumbing (`index.ts` - BotSDK)
- Low-level API that maps to the game protocol
- Actions resolve when the game **acknowledges** the command (fast)
- Low domain knowledge - just sends commands and receives results
- Changes slowly, is supported by the gateway and bot client 

```typescript
await sdk.sendInteractLoc(tree.x, tree.z, tree.id, 1);
await sdk.sendWalk(x, z, running);
```

### Porcelain (`actions.ts` - BotActions)
- High-level, domain-aware API that wraps plumbing
- Actions resolve when the **effect is complete** (slower, but reliable)
- Encodes domain knowledge and handles edge cases


```typescript
await bot.chopTree();  // Waits for logs in inventory
await bot.walkTo(x, z); // Pathfinding + arrival confirmation
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. Game Messages Persist in Buffer
Old messages like "You can't light a fire here" persist. Filter by tick:

```typescript
const startTick = this.sdk.getState()?.tick || 0;
// Only check messages where msg.tick > startTick
```

### 2. Level-Up Dialogs Are Multi-Page
Keep clicking every few ticks while open:

```typescript
if (state.dialog.isOpen && (state.tick - lastClick) >= 3) {
    this.sdk.sendClickDialog(0).catch(() => {});
}
```

### 3. Choose the Right Success Signal

| Action | Reliable Signal |
|--------|-----------------|
| Firemaking | XP gain |
| Woodcutting | Logs in inventory OR tree disappears |
| Pickup | Item in inventory |
| Walking | Player position matches destination |
| Shop Buy | Item appears in inventory |
| Equip | Item leaves inventory |

### 4. Interface Components: buttonType vs iop
- `interface.options` has entries → use `sendClickInterface(optionIndex)`
- `debugInfo` shows `iop=[...]` → use `sendClickInterfaceComponent(componentId, optionIndex)`
