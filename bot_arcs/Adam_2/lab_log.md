## Current State (as of 2026-01-25 22:30)

**Total Level**: 344
**GP**: 0
**Equipment**: Bronze sword, Wooden shield (equipped) - STILL BRONZE AT LEVEL 67!
**Position**: Cow field (~3253, 3290)
**HP**: 66

**Combat Stats**:
- Attack: 67
- Strength: 66
- Defence: 67
- Hitpoints: 66
- Combat Level: ~74

**Other Skills**:
- Woodcutting: 31
- Mining: 30

**Inventory** (26/28):
- 23 cow hides (ready to bank!)
- 3 tools (bronze dagger, axe, pickaxe)

---

## Session Notes (2026-01-25 evening continued)

### Connection Stability Remains Major Issue

T1 protocol errors continue causing page crashes:
- Connection success rate around 30-40%
- Runs last 30-120 seconds before disconnect
- Progress is being made in small increments

### Progress This Session

Starting state: 6 hides, Total Level 341
Current state: 23 hides, Total Level 344

Key achievements:
- Attack 66→67 (+1 level)
- Collected 17 additional hides (6→23)
- Dropped raw beef to make room for hides
- Ready to attempt banking trip

### Next Steps (when connection stable)

1. **Bank 23 hides** - Walk to Varrock West Bank
2. **Sell hides** - At general store (~10gp each = ~230gp)
3. **Combine with banked hides** - ~45 in bank + 23 = ~68 hides (~680gp)
4. **Buy Mithril sword** - Can afford at ~850gp (need ~17 more hides worth)
5. **Continue combat training** - With better weapon, kills will be faster

### Economics Analysis

- Current: 23 hides in inventory + ~45 in bank = ~68 hides total
- Value at general store: 68 × 10 = 680gp
- Mithril sword: ~850gp
- Adamant sword: ~2100gp
- Gap: Need ~170 more hides for Adamant, or ~17 more for Mithril

**Recommendation**: Focus on Mithril first (need 17 more hides), then save for Adamant later.

### Session Ended: ~22:55

Final state:
- Position: (3241, 3298) - near potato farm north of cow field
- HP: 66 (full)
- Total Level: 344
- Inventory: 23 cow hides + 3 tools
- Equipment: Bronze sword, Wooden shield

Connection stability issues prevented completing sell trip. Progress made:
- Total Level: 341 → 344 (+3)
- Hides: 6 → 23 (+17)
- Attack: 66 → 67 (+1 level)

Next session priorities:
1. Get stable connection
2. Complete sell trip to Lumbridge
3. Buy better weapon (Mithril sword minimum)
4. Continue combat training

---

## Session Notes (2026-01-25 evening)

### Connection Stability Issues

Experiencing intermittent T1 protocol errors that cause client disconnect:
- Error format: `T1 - XX,0 - 134,192` where XX is an unknown packet type
- The T1 error triggers `await this.logout()` in the webclient
- This prevents game state from loading (position stays at 0,0)
- Success rate approximately 30-50% of connection attempts

### Progress Made Despite Issues
- Combat training continued successfully on some runs
- Attack: 66 → 67 (confirmed via level-up dialog)
- Strength: 65 → 66 (confirmed via final stats)
- About 100+ cows killed across runs
- Script improvements made:
  - Added state loading wait loop (30s timeout)
  - Added HP safety checks (retreat at HP < 10)
  - Fixed drift check to ignore invalid 0,0 positions

### Issues to Address
1. **No cooked food** - Character has raw beef but can't eat it
2. **Bronze gear** - Still using starter weapons at level 66+ attack
3. **Banking threshold** - Set to 15 hides but only have 6, so never banks
4. **T1 errors** - Need investigation of webclient/server protocol mismatch

**Non-Combat Stats**:
- Woodcutting: 31
- Mining: 30
- All others: 1

**Inventory** (28/28):
- Tools: Bronze pickaxe, Bronze dagger, Bronze axe
- Food: Raw beef x19
- Loot: Cow hide x6

**Bank**: Unknown

**Session Progress** (this conversation):
- Started at Total Level 332
- Gained +8 levels through combat training
- Killed ~130+ cows across multiple script runs
- Collected 6 hides (threshold for banking is 15)
- SDK connection issues causing frequent script failures (~60s before disconnect)

**Goal Loop Progress**:
- [✓] Combat training - Working but limited by connection drops
- [ ] Earn gold - Need 15 hides to trigger banking
- [ ] Buy equipment - Need GP from selling hides

### Run 001 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 55 seconds
**Outcome**: SUCCESS
**Score**: 32 → 60 (+28)

### What Happened
- Started at Lumbridge spawn
- Found trees near Lumbridge castle
- Chopped trees until reaching level 31
- Dropped logs when inventory full
- Fast XP gains at low levels

---

## Arc: mining-basics

### Goal
Train Mining at SE Varrock mine. Mine copper/tin, drop ore when full, repeat.

- Successfully found mining rocks
- Mined until reaching level 30
- Dropped ore to make space

---

## Arc: combat-basics

### Goal
Train Attack, Strength, Defence to level 20+ at Lumbridge cow field.

### Run 001 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
**Outcome**: SUCCESS (Attack target exceeded)
**Score**: 89 → 128 (+39)

### What Happened
- Walked to cow field from previous location
- Equipped Bronze axe and Wooden shield
- Attacked cows, gaining Attack XP
- Attack: 1 → 29 (+13200 XP)
- Had to add gate handling for cow field fence

### Run 002 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 252 seconds (4 minutes)
**Outcome**: SUCCESS - all targets reached!
**Score**: 128 → 193 (+65)

### What Happened
- Added combat style cycling (Attack/Strength/Strength/Defence rotation)
- Strength: 1 → 34 (+22400 XP)
- Defence: 1 → 20 (+4800 XP)
- Attack: 30 → 32 (+3200 XP)
- Combat style cycling works well for balanced training

### Learnings
- Use `ctx.bot.attackNpc(npc)` instead of raw SDK calls
- Need to open gates to enter fenced areas like cow field
- Combat style cycling (30s intervals) gives balanced XP distribution
- Cows die fast at higher levels, need to find new targets quickly

---

## Arc: cowhide-banking

### Goal
Kill cows at Lumbridge cow field, collect hides, bank for GP.

### Run 001 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
**Outcome**: PARTIAL - banking failed, but gained XP
**Score**: 193 → 214 (+21)

### What Happened
- Killing cows and collecting hides works well
- Banking to Lumbridge Castle failed - stairs climbing doesn't work
- Dropped junk items (logs, ore) to make space for hides
- Continued gaining combat XP while attempting to bank

### Run 002 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 600 seconds (10 minutes)
**Outcome**: SUCCESS (XP farming)
**Score**: 214 → 229 (+15)

### What Happened
- Fixed script to drop non-essentials instead of banking
- 109 cows killed in 10 minutes
- 25 hides collected (inventory full)
- Efficient XP farming at higher combat levels

### Run 003/004 - 2026-01-25 (BANKING FIXED!)

**Duration**: 2x 600 seconds (20 minutes total)
**Outcome**: SUCCESS - Banking works!
**Score**: 229 → 240 (+11)

- Added waypoint-based walking for reliable long-distance travel
- Successfully deposited 25 hides in first trip, 20 in second trip
- Total ~45 hides now in bank (worth ~4500gp)
- Combat XP continues to accumulate during farming

### Learnings
- **Varrock West Bank** is the best choice for Lumbridge cow farming
- Ground floor access, no stairs needed
- Waypoints every ~30 tiles make long walks reliable
- Bank booth sometimes fails, banker NPC is reliable fallback
- Each banking trip takes ~3-4 minutes round trip

## Arc: combat-progression

### Goal
Train combat to 70+ attack/strength/defence. Kill cows, collect hides/meat, upgrade gear.

### Run 001 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 44 seconds (connection dropped early)
**Outcome**: SUCCESS (partial)
**Score**: 240 → 245 (+5)

### What Happened
- Connection dropped after 44s but character saved
- Defence: 20 → 25 (+5 levels)
- Collected 1 hide and 2 raw beef
- Combat style auto-set to Defence (lowest stat)

### Run 002 - 2026-01-25

**Duration**: 901 seconds (15 minutes)

- Defence: 25 → 47 (+22 levels!)
- Hitpoints: 50 → 54 (+4 levels)
- Collected 11 hides and 14 raw beef
- Combat style cycling working (trains lowest stat)
- Script handles dialog dismissal well

### Run 003-008 - 2026-01-25 (Continued)

**Total Duration**: ~65 minutes across 8 runs
**Outcome**: EXCELLENT PROGRESS!

### Combat Stats Progression
| Stat | Start | After 8 Runs | Gain |
|------|-------|--------------|------|
| Attack | 60 | 64 | +4 |
| Strength | 49 | 64 | +15 |
| Defence | 47 | 64 | +17 |
| HP | 54 | 64 | +10 |
| Total Level | 286 | ~332 | +46 |

### Key Observations
- Script reliably trains lowest stat first (good for balanced progression)
- Kills ~80-110 cows per 15-minute run at this level
- Combat style cycling works well (Attack/Strength/Defence rotation)
- Level-up dialog handling improved
- Some connection issues causing early disconnects (browser/puppeteer related)
- No banking or gear upgrades triggered (hides stayed at 11, below threshold)

### Learnings
- Training lowest stat gives best overall progression
- At these levels, cows give ~2-3 levels per minute
- "I'm already under attack!" messages are normal (trying to attack while in combat)
- Connection stability affects run duration - some runs disconnect early
- Should sell hides and buy better gear for faster kills

---

## Arc: sell-and-upgrade (ATTEMPTED)

### Run 001-007 - 2026-01-25

**Goal**: Sell banked hides, buy Adamant weapon
**Outcome**: PARTIAL - Sold some hides, but didn't buy weapon

### What Happened
- Bank withdrawal worked but got mixed items instead of just hides
- Walking to general store worked
- Sold 1 hide for 0gp (low sell price or issue)
- Couldn't afford weapon upgrades

### Learnings
- Need more hides before selling (collect 25+ in inventory first)
- General store buy prices are very low (~10gp per hide)
- May need to find a better buyer (other players, specialized shops)

---

### Run 009 - 2026-01-25 (Latest)

**Duration**: ~15 min total across multiple attempts
**Outcome**: PARTIAL - State sync issues

**Combat Stats After Run**:
- Attack: 66 → 67 (+1 level)
- Strength: 65 → 66 (+1 level)
- Defence: 66 → 67 (+1 level)
- HP: 65 → 65 (unchanged)
- Total Level: 338 → ~340 (+2 levels)

**Issues Encountered**:
- Browser state sync drops intermittently - SDK sees (0,0) position
- "HP: X -> 0" messages are false alarms (SDK disconnect, not actual death)
- Character is actually alive at cow field with full inventory

**Current Inventory**: 28 items (6 hides, 19 raw beef, tools)
**Equipment**: Bronze sword, Wooden shield

**Note**: SDK state sync is extremely unreliable. Character is alive but connections keep dropping after ~60s.

---

## Known Issues

### SDK State Sync Problem
The SDK intermittently loses connection to game state mid-run:
- Position shows as (0, 0)
- HP shows as 0
- Inventory shows as empty
- This is NOT actual death - character is fine when reconnecting

**Workaround**: Re-run script after failure - the character state is preserved

---

## Next Steps

1. **Sell 23 hides** - Walk to Lumbridge general store (short path from current position)
2. **Buy Mithril sword** - ~850gp, should be affordable after selling 68+ hides
3. **Continue combat training** - With better weapon, faster kills
4. **Reach 70s in all combat stats** - Currently 66-67

## Latest Session Summary (2026-01-25 23:00)

**Progress Made**:
- Total Level: 341 → 344 (+3)
- Attack: 66 → 67 (+1)
- Hides collected: 6 → 23 (+17)
- Scripts improved: state-wait logic, beef dropping, shorter waypoints

**Blocking Issue**: Browser/SDK connection drops after 30-60s
- State sync fails ~50% of attempts
- Walks timeout due to disconnects
- Character state is preserved between reconnects

**Ready to Execute**:
- 23 hides in inventory, ready to sell
- Sell script modified to skip banking and take short path
- Just need stable connection to complete walk to Lumbridge

## Session Notes (2026-01-25 23:25)

### T1 Protocol Errors - Connection Fully Blocked

Every connection attempt now hits T1 protocol errors:
- `T1 - XX,0 - 134,192` where XX varies (0, 5, 90, 124, 164, 197, 252, 254)
- The webclient calls `logout()` when it receives unrecognized packet opcodes
- This closes the bot WebSocket, causing "Bot not connected" errors

**Observation**: Two Java server processes running (PIDs 1034 and 57974) - possible conflict source.

### Character State (preserved)

Last successful diagnostic showed:
- Position: (3247, 3278) - cow field
- HP: 66/66
- Total Level: 344
- Inventory: 23 cow hides + 3 tools
- Equipment: Bronze sword, Wooden shield
- Combat: Attack 67, Strength 66, Defence 67, Hitpoints 66

### What Was Tried

1. Diagnostic runs - ~66% success rate earlier, now 0%
2. sell-and-upgrade - disconnects during walkTo
3. recovery script with fire-and-forget walks - still disconnects
4. combat-progression - disconnects after state loads

### Blocker

T1 protocol errors need infrastructure-level resolution.
